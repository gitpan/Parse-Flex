Parse/Flex version 0.01
=======================

Parse::Flex works similar to Parse::Lex, but it uses XS for faster per-
formance.

This module allows the user to implement a customized lexer analyzer
with his own rules.  It is expected that you will supply your own
rules; otherwise, the default rules might not be very useful.

Read the perldoc about Custom Rules & Libraries, and how to load them.
